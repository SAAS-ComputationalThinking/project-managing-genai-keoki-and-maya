The objective in this lesson is to make a simple game using chatGPT (or some similar tool -- claude, Bard, codex, and many others can also do this kind of thing) Examples of games include click counters, side-scrollers like Flappy Bird, a “Snake” game, etc. Talk to Mark about your idea before you begin coding.
You should start a session on an AI chat system, then explain the game you are working on. Explain that the page is split into three files, index.html, script.js, and style.css, and that you want help figuring out how to structure the html, how to control the style, and how to implement the interactive elements. You will have to tell the AI system that you want to work in “vanilla javascript without any plugins” – this will help it keep your code in a similar style to the way we have been working so far. You should also tell it not to give you all three files at once, and that when you ask it to change something, not to change the entire file – tell it to give back to you only the things that have changed, and where to put them, and to explain what the changes accomplish.
You should not paste in any code that you do not understand – if you don’t understand it, figure it out before you use it..
As you work, keep a record of the interactions you have with the AI system. Your repository should include a file
When we’re done, we’re going to debrief the process, using some of these questions (and others)

Did you enjoy working with a generative AI tool as a code assistant?
Working with AI simplified the process and sped it up a lot, which was nice and very convenient. It also provided us with examples so we could better understand each element.

What was more difficult about using the AI tool, rather than doing it yourself? What was less difficult?
It would occasionally not give us exactly what we wanted, and it’s hard to communicate exactly what you want with ai.

Did the AI tool ever give you code that was wrong? What did it do?
It gave us some kinda ugly css files that we had to scrap

What advice do you have about how to interact with an AI tool to get better results?
Trial and error is super important, don’t just blindly trust that the code will be correct. Additionally, you should be as specific as you can be when requesting things from AI, and don’t be afraid to regenerate things or edit them yourself to get it to fit properly.

# pm-genAI


The objective in this lesson is to make a simple game using chatGPT (or some similar tool -- claude, Bard, codex, and many others can also do this kind of thing)  Examples of games include click counters, side-scrollers like Flappy Bird, a “Snake” game, etc. Talk to Mark about your idea before you begin coding.

1. You should start a session on an AI chat system, then explain the game you are working on.  Explain that the page is split into three files, index.html, script.js, and style.css, and that you want help figuring out how to structure the html, how to control the style, and how to implement the interactive elements.  You will have to tell the AI system that you want to work in “vanilla javascript without any plugins” – this will help it keep your code in a similar style to the way we have been working so far.  You should also tell it not to give you all three files at once, and that when you ask it to change something, not to change the entire file – tell it to give back to you only the things that have changed, and where to put them, and to explain what the changes accomplish.

2. You should not paste in any code that you do not understand – if you don’t understand it, figure it out before you use it..

3. As you work, keep a record of the interactions you have with the AI system.  Your repository should include a file 

4. When we’re done, we’re going to debrief the process, using some of these questions (and others)

* Did you enjoy working with a generative AI tool as a code assistant?
 I think it was helpful and interesting, and it helped me learn how to do new stuff. Addionally it helped me create stuff that would be above my level if I tried to code it.
* What was *more* difficult about using the AI tool, rather than doing it yourself? What was less difficult?
I think the most diffucult part of using ai was getting it to generate what you want because some times you would ask it one thing and it would give you another thing.
* Did the AI tool ever give you code that was wrong?  What did it do?
Nope it always gave us code that worked and to a degree was what we wanted but it never gave it code that didn't work at all. 
* What advice do you have about how to interact with an AI tool to get better results? 
I think my advice would be to be very specific when asking an AI to do something as the more specific you are the more likely the AI is to generate what you want.
